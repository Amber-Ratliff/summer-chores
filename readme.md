# Summer Chore Callback Hell!

This project uses node.js

John has a lot of summer chores he needs to complete each Saturday, but he often gets tired and needs to take a nap.
If John falls asleep, he will not complete his chores.

This program simulates a probability of John falling asleep after completing each chore using a randomly generated number and 
checking if it is greater than a percentage (in decimal form). 
The probability of John falling asleep increases with each chore he completes.
